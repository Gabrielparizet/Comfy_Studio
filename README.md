<h1>Comfy Studio ðŸª‘</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Comfy Studio</strong> is a second-hand furniture webstore developed from scratch in a group of ten classmates. 
    <br>
    Spread over two weeks, our group was divided in two, with one half working on the back-end, while the other worked on the front, before exchanging roles during the second week.
</p>
<p>
    Creating this webstore application from scratch, we had complete liberty over our choice of technologies. The front-end of the project was hence developed using React.js and Tailwind.css for styles.
    Being the first project where we had to create an entire back-end side of the application, my personal choice was to lean over the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the entire project. However, prefering to practice our recently acquired MySQL skills, we decided to lean over a back-end side done in Node.js, Express.js and raw MySQL using Node.js Sequelize module.
